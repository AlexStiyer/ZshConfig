# Zsh Config

The ZSH config I use at work and at home.

The Random Colors are not to everyone's taste, I like it to tell the difference between different shells I have open. 
Sometimes you get a bad color, that can be fixed by running `reload` to re-source the rc file and reload the prompt.

Requirements and troubleshooting tips can be found in the file so you don't need to jump between your browser and terminal to fix things.

**Why I use this:**
- Zap Plugin Manager is lighterweight and more ergonomic than OMZ
- Single File Configuration so I don't get lost in directories when I make my bi-annual changes
- "Wombo" Prompt Provides Basic Git Information at a glance and displays Battery Life for a nerd flex
